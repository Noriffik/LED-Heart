# LED-Heart
This is a quick and dirty board I designed for Valentine's day. It uses an ATMega48 which I had laying around, and 35 ws2812 RGB LEDs.

You can read more about the project on my blog: http://htonoyan.blogspot.com. For any questions feel free to contact me by email or posting on the blog.

* Hardware/ Contains all the circuit board files (Altium Designer format, but a PDF version and gerbers are provided).
* Software/ Contains the code running on the AVR ATMega48. I used Atmel Studio with gcc to compile the code.
